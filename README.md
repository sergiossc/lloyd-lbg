Vector Quantization applied on Codebook Design problem: LBG algorithm
Linde, Y., Buzo, A., & Gray, R. (1980). An algorithm for vector quantizer design. IEEE Transactions on communications, 28(1), 84-95.

This simulation begins defining a DFT codebook with size N by user. Then k noise-contaminated samples are created from it. Finally, these samples are presented to LBG algorithm. The results are encoded and stored in *.json files.
